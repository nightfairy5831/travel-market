AidHandy – Phase 1 Technical Summary (Neutral Developer Handoff)
1. Core Product Logic Implemented
Companion Onboarding
Registration form
Basic profile fields
Email verification flow
Stripe Connect Express onboarding workflow (partial; requires US test-mode validation)
Basic companion dashboard structure
Traveler Onboarding (Initial Version)
Custom sign-up form tied to Supabase Auth
Basic traveler account creation
Email verification
Flow requires refinement to match the companion-first UX
Authentication
Supabase OTP + magic link
Session handling
Initial RLS policies

2. Email, SMS & Notifications
Completed
Postmark transactional email setup
Twilio Messaging Service configured and verified
Basic booking and onboarding notifications
Requires Refinement in Phase 2
Remove double email verification
Consolidate flows for smoother UX
Move advanced automation (pre-flight reminders, assignment updates) to Phase 2

3. Schema & Database Work
Implemented
Users
Companions
Bookings
Basic pricing
Travel details
Stripe account connection fields
Recommended Enhancements (Early Phase 2)
Add placeholder fields for future logic:
Add-ons
Payout metadata
Multi-flight discount rules
Seat-matching logic
Admin audit fields
Companion rating/metrics fields
These don’t need business logic yet, just schema support

4. Payments Integration
Completed
Stripe Connect Express account link creation
Redirect flow partially integrated
Requires US Test-Mode Validation
To complete:
Express onboarding (redirect → return)
Payout simulation
Webhook events (account.updated, payout.created)

5. CI/CD, Repo & Deployment
Repo Structure
nextapp/ contains the application code
Static HTML marketing pages exist separately (not part of app logic)
Branching
main → production
staging → preview environment
Deployment Observations
CI/CD pipelines were prepared
Collaborator access limited due to Vercel plan tier
Environment variables need secure re-entry in Phase 2
Some preview deployments failed due to missing/outdated env variables

Phase 2 Developer Starting Notes
1. Codebase Audit
Validate architecture
Clean up assumptions
Standardize patterns
Confirm database constraints

2. Streamline Registration Flows
Only one email verification
Internal “verified” flag stored in DB
Smooth traveler + companion onboarding
3. Extend Schema Early
Add placeholders for payouts, add-ons, pricing rules, seat matching, and admin audit fields
4. Clean Up CI/CD
Stabilize staging
Ensure secure env variable handling
Validate branch-based deployment flow
5. Prepare for Key Phase 2 Logic
Seat adjacency/matching logic
Dynamic pricing
Add-ons
Multi-flight handling
Refined booking flows
